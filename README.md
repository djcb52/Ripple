Ripple – Secure, offline-first personal data manager for Android and Windows


Ripple is a privacy-first personal data vault that gives you total control. No internet connection required. No cloud backups. No tracking. Just a clean, simple way to store your passwords, notes, serial numbers, or anything else — right on your device.
Your Data. Your Rules.
Everything stays local and fully readable on your device. But when you export to another device, Ripple encrypts your backup and provides a unique unlock key — so only you can restore it securely. No third-party servers, ever.
Windows Included
Ripple works on Android and Windows. If you’ve bought the Android version, you can unlock the Windows version for free — just grab it from the official download link (included in the app or user manual).
Built-In Tools
• Crop, rotate, and label images using the built-in editor
• Create unlimited categories and records (after unlocking)
• Quickly search across your stored data
• Backups you control — export, import, and reindex your vault manually
Licensing Made Simple
Ripple starts in free mode with limited records and categories. One small payment unlocks everything — forever. No subscriptions. No sneaky upgrades.
Offline Manual Provided
A full, step-by-step user manual is included with the app. No need to go online to figure things out.
No Ads. No Analytics. No Bull.
Ripple doesn’t want your data. It’s not sending telemetry, it’s not asking for logins, and it never nags you with pop-ups. This is independence, by design.
